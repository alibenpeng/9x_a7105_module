## JR/Graupner/FlySky/Turnigy compatible A7105 TX module

This module replaces the carrier board of the stock module found in FlySky/Turnigy 9x transmitters (and probably others).
It is possible to re-use almost all components from the original carrier board (bind-button, connector, regulator and caps).
To use the original A7105 TX module, you'll have to cut open the metal casing (if applicable) and remove the MCU.
